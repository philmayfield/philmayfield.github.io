<h2>Incontinence FAQ</h3>

<h3><a name="good nights sleep"></a>How can my child and I get a good night’s sleep?</h3>
<p>Parents or carers can become frustrated with changing the bed during the night – it disrupts not only your sleep, but also the child’s, and there is the added concern of calming a child down after an accident. By using an absorbent and waterproof bed pad on top of the bottom sheet of the bed, along with a mattress protector (Toggles or Micro-Plush fitted sheet), it is as simple as taking the bed pad off the bed and replacing it with another. The process with a bed pad is much quicker and easier than a full bed change allowing you and the child to quickly return to bed, and potentially reducing the laundry the next day. If the child requires comforter/quilt protection, Conni can help with specific waterproof area protection.</p>
